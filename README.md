# InstaSave
is a very simple Chrome Extension (that has been renamed in the store to Instant Save for Instagram and Flickr due to an infringement complaint) to add a right-click option on Instagram and Flickr that downloads images directly to the default download directory.

Labs features also include a SaveStorm mode that downloads from any click on the website, and bulk downloader for open tabs.
